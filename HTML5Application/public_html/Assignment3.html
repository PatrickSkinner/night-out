        <p> To use the emulator, link the application's script name in the index.html file and load the index.html to run it </p>
            


        <h2> How the Application works </h2>
        <p>
            Load the Index.html file, this runs the emulator which in turns loads the application. The application is simple in use, First off it gives you four 
            different options, this includes Food, Pub, Clubs and Taxi. You can click on any of them which loads up the next list. This includes a set of different 
            options that the user can select, this shows a link to the selected option, and a directions button that loads a map with directions to the option from your 
            current position. Back buttons are on every screen allowing the user to get back to the first four main options. 
        </p>
      
        
        <h2>Tools we used</h2>
        <p>
            We used Netbeans, this was our ide which was very useful using the git function of the ide. This allowed us to use version control 
            very effectively and often which helped great with us working on different parts of the application and emulator. Also with Netbeans the built 
            in JSTestDriver service which was the library we used to create the test cases and run the emulator and application unit tests and run them in different browsers
            such as Firefox, safari and Chrome seemly. //need to add some more tools if we used them. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our experience </h2>
        <p>
            Matthew Lang
            The differences of Making test cases in a new language was a new experience, it was hard not knowing what could work in the tests and how i could try to break the
            functions i was given to test. Also working with a large group and with git was very intreseing and getting everyone to meet up was a hard task.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dylan Pringle
            My role in the group was UI/logo artwork and design. My main tool I used was Adobe Photoshop CS3. Artwork and design inspiration originated from visualizing what mood 
            our target audience would be in when using our application. Our audience will be craving a fun, social experience, so I decided to use bright attractive colors for 
            buttons and panels to reflect this sense of fun and excitement. The biggest frustration I faced while designing was that the bright colors would sometimes make 
            intricate details in the app difficult to see because of its small UI. Colors would also occasionally clash with each other. These issues required delicate blending 
            and tweaking of colors. This was not a huge issue but did take some experimentation and time to get right.
            As a group I feel we all worked very well together. We divided up roles and tasks effectively even though we had five members in the group. We were always able to 
            discuss ideas and issues cohesively while at all times remaining very positive and encouraging towards each other. We worked mostly during weekends together in the 
            university labs so we had very good close communication when putting all the applications pieces together. I would happily work with my group members again in the 
            future.
