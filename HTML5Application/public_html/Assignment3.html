        <p> To use the emulator the application should be loaded from index.html in place of the existing Application.js file, the application can then be launched by opening the index.html page. </p>
            


        <h2> How the Application works </h2>
        <p>
            Load the Index.html file, this loads both the emulator and the application files, and creates a new canvas for the emulator to run inside. Ensure that geolocation is supported and 
            enabled in your browser. The application is simple to use, first off it gives you four different options, this includes Food, Pub, Clubs and Taxi. You can click on any of them which loads up 
            a list of venues or services. Click a venue takes you too an information display screen about the venue, this screen includes a link to the venues website, and a "Get directions" button that loads a map with directions to the location chosen from your 
            current position. Back buttons are on every screen allowing the user to get back to the first four main options. 
        </p>
      
        
        <h2>Tools we used</h2>
        <p>
            We used Netbeans as our chosen IDE, our initial report outlined how we were already familiar with Netbeans and it's GitHub integration. This allowed us to use version control 
            very effectively and often which helped greatly with us each working on different parts of the application and emulator simultaneously. Another advantage of Netbeans was the built 
            in JSTestDriver service, which was the library we used to create the test cases and run the emulator and application unit tests, allowing us to easily run them simultaneously in different browsers
            such as Firefox, Safari and Chrome. 2D art assets were created with Photoshop and Inkscape, Photoshop was again chosen due to familiarity, while Inkscape was used as it is a freely available piece of Open Source
            software.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        We had no problems with our application behaving differently between any of the 3 browsers we tested, this was likely due to our reliance on pure Javascript, with a handful of lines of HTML and CSS contained
        in our index file. This ensured our application and emulator would run the same in any browser that supported the HTML5 canvas and geolocation.
        
        <h2>Our experience </h2>
        <p>
            Matthew Lang
            My role in the group was unit testing, and doing any odd job that was needed by the group, the difficulties of Making test cases in a new language was a new experience, 
            it was hard not knowing what could work in the tests and how i could try to break the functions i was given to test. Also working with a large group and with git was very interesting
            and getting everyone to meet up was a hard task.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dylan Pringle
            My role in the group was UI/logo artwork and design. My main tool I used was Adobe Photoshop CS3. Artwork and design inspiration originated from visualizing what mood 
            our target audience would be in when using our application. Our audience will be craving a fun, social experience, so I decided to use bright attractive colors for 
            buttons and panels to reflect this sense of fun and excitement. The biggest frustration I faced while designing was that the bright colors would sometimes make 
            intricate details in the app difficult to see because of its small UI. Colors would also occasionally clash with each other. These issues required delicate blending 
            and tweaking of colors. This was not a huge issue but did take some experimentation and time to get right.
            As a group I feel we all worked very well together. We divided up roles and tasks effectively even though we had five members in the group. We were always able to 
            discuss ideas and issues cohesively while at all times remaining very positive and encouraging towards each other. We worked mostly during weekends together in the 
            university labs so we had very good close communication when putting all the applications pieces together. I would happily work with my group members again in the 
            future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patrick Skinner
            My role in the group was to outline the design of application and create the emulator. I did both these tasks as the functionality provided by the emulator was dictated by the 
            proposed design of the application and the functionality it would require.
